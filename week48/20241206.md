I am Yang Yu, a Master's student in Embedded Systems at Eindhoven University of Technology, writing to express my interest in pursuing a PhD and Research Assistant position under your guidance. Your research in computer architecture, and their intersection with machine learning and high-performance computing aligns closely with my academic background and research aspirations.

In a recent OSOC (ysyx) project, I developed a RISC-V ISA simulator as part of a hardware-software co-design for a multi-cycle processor. This involved creating runtime environments, implementing peripherals, and debugging through high-level simulation using Verilator. This experience provided me with hands-on expertise in simulator development and architecture verification, which I am eager to apply in your research on improving the performance and resource efficiency of heterogeneous computing systems.

I am particularly interested in your work on memory systems. I also contacted with Professor Yifan, Sun, his academic interests also aligned with my love on the domain of simulator and software-hardware co-design. I wander if I can be under both of yours' co-supervision. 

I plan to pursue a PhD starting in Fall 2025 or Spring 2026 I have attached my resume and study overview for your reference and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills align with your team's projects.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to the innovative work in your group.

Best regards,

Yang Yu
