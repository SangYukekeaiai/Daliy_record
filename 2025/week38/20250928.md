### Task 1
#### TMT 1 Block 1
1. **Goals**
   1. Submit the current branch, switch to dev_loose_dram
   2. Based on the current version, try to re-implement the input_spine_buffer, think about the input_spine_buffer's construction
   3. If we have time, let's do the control logic inside each components, so we need to change the intermediate fifo and the min_finder_batch
2. **Results**
   1. Finish the goal 1, part of goal 2

#### TMT 1 Block 2
1. **Goals**
   1. Build up the dram.cpp/hpp.
   2. Think about the abstraction level of spinalflow's input_spine_buffer.
   3. make the input_spine_buffer neat.
2. **Result**
   1. Finished the dram.cpp/hpp
   2. I think at the moment the input_spine_buffer is good.

#### TMT 2 Block 1
1. **Goals**
   1. Adjust the min_finder_batch.
      1. What does min_finder need from the input_spine_buffer side?
      2. What dose min_finder need to the intermediate fifo side?
   2. Adjust the intermediate fifo.
      1. The same as before
      2. The same as before
2. **Result**
   1. Did not finish what the goal mentioned. It is needed to go through the builder.cpp, try to list which part you actually want to hide in the components themselves.

#### TMT 2 Block 2
1. **Goals**
   1. List the thing you want to hide.
   2. Try to see if it is possible to hide them. What meta data is needed for that part.
   3.
