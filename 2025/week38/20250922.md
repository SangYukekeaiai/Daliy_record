3. TMT 2 Block 2: This part seems ok right now. Try to do the task 3.2

##### Task 3.2
3. TMT 2 Block 3: Get destracted, and I think I cannot focus in a short time. Find a way to do the output-queue collection.
4. TMT 3 Block 1: 
   * **Task:**  Make sure the scope stops in the generation of a list of entries, and the latency of each stage should be crystal clear.
   * **Results:**
