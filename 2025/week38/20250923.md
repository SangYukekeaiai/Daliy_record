## Timeline-schedule
1. 6:45-9:00 Task 1, task 2 part 1 part 2
2. 9:15-11:30 Task 2
3. 11:30-14:00 Lunch and Rest

3. 14:20-15:20 Task 2 part 3 and part 4.
4. 15:30-16:30 Task 2 part 5 and part 6.
5. 16:30-17:30 Task 3.
6.

## Timeline-schedule v3
1. 18:30-19:30 Try to think about the implementation on the builder.cpp/hpp, and also the output_queue.cpp/hpp


## Task 1
1. TMT 1 BLOCK 1:
   * **Goals:** Try to change the output of the stage 1, then integrate the output queue.
   * **Result:** Not finished. Now I am doing the integration part and optimize it.
## Task 2
### Task 2.1
1. TMT 1 Block 1: Understand a little bit of the updates of the cycles.
2. TMT 1 Block 2:
   1. **Goal:** 
      1. ~~Further understand how the latency is computing.~~ 
      2. ~~Separate it in another folder (stats/utils)~~
      3. Separate the Stage 1 into 2 stages.
   2. **Result:**
      1. Finish the task 2.1.1, 2.1.2
3. TMT 1 Block 3:
   1. **Goal:**
      1. Check the logic of the Stage 0, make sure the capacity of output_queue is 128, and it should be blocked once it is full.
      2. Check the logic of the Stage 1, if the hardware implementation is too complicated, change it to two stage.
      3. Check the logic of stage 2.
   2. Result:
      1. Not finished. A issue happens. The computation of the neuron id.
4. TMT 1 Block 4:
   1. **Goal:**
      1. Build the lut/map between the neuron id and the pe index. It would be better to add one member in pe? 
      2. Change the builder.cpp/hpp
