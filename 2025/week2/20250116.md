## Task 1
### Question and Answer
1. what is the interface of go language?

    **Answer:** It is impilict
2. Not totally understand the NotifyRecv part and the other part

### Notes
1. from my understanding, the port is able to:
    * receive messages from the connection and schedule the event for its components
    * send the messages of a event from its own component to the connection
2. The embedded interface confuses me for a while, I need to extend them to know what it is at least in msg.go

#### msg
```go
package sim

// A Msg is a piece of information that is transferred between components.
type Msg interface {
	Meta() *MsgMeta
}

// MsgMeta contains the meta data that is attached to every message.
type MsgMeta struct {
	ID                 string
	Src                {
        Name() string
        // AcceptHook registers a hook.
        AcceptHook(hook Hook)

        // NumHooks returns the number of hooks registered.
        NumHooks() int

        // Hooks returns all the hooks registered.
        Hooks() []Hook
        SetConnection(conn Connection)
        Component() Component
        // For connection
        Recv(msg Msg) *SendError
        NotifyAvailable(now VTimeInSec)

        // For component
        CanSend() bool
        Send(msg Msg) *SendError
        Retrieve(now VTimeInSec) Msg
        Peek() Msg

    }
    Dst           Port
	SendTime, RecvTime VTimeInSec
	TrafficClass       int
	TrafficBytes       int
}
```
