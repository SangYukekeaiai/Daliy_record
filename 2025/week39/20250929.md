## Task 1.1
### Part 1 Goals
1. Finish the integration of stage 1 and the core.cpp/hpp
2. Optional: Finish the integration of the stage 2.
### Part 1 Result
1. Not finished, switch back to the previous chat.

### Part 2 Goals
1. Make sure the output_queue is integrated.
2. Do the smallest_ts_piker later.

### Part 2 Result
1. smallest_ts_picker not totally finished.

### Part 3 Goals
1. Forget about the pattern design things, remember the rules: make it simple and stupid
2. Try to finish the smallest_ts_picker.

### Part 3 Result
1. Finished, but still need modification
   
### Part 4 Goals
1. Try to model the backpressure on the Stage 1/2 part.
### Result
1. Not done

### Part 5 Goals
1. Try to model the back_pressure on the Stage 1/2 part. List the control signal, list what the logic should be.
2. Implement the model.

### Try to think about the dram's format for output_queue save, input_spine_buffer load and weight load.
