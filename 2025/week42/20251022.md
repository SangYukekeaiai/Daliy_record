## Tasks
1. ~~Make the graph of the distribution of miss/hit (3 blocks)~~
2. ~~Print the whole set's member, After [MISS][CONFLICT] (in a new git branch)~~
3. At each time steps, we need to get the distribution of tiles in the cache. Do the computation theoritically.
4. Wrong eviction distribution--For each tile, In one tile, throughout the whole time steps, the number of one cache line got evicted and reused. 
5. Optional: Do the distribution of tile-id verse sets during the time.
6. **Clean up tasks:** 
   1. Change the name of hit/miss distribution, also need to change the default name in script.


### possible design strategies
1. For eviction policy, make sure to stay the cache line with current tile id.
2. For pre-fetch, 
   set: tile 0, tile 1


### timeline-schedule
1. 9:40-10:10 Task 1 part 1
2. 10:10-10:40 part 2

### Task 1 traces
#### Block 3
##### Goals
1. ~~Fix the legend overlapping stuff~~
2. ~~Choose which figure to be generated~~
3. ~~Scan all the layers under stats/repo4/vgg16 and generate all the figures that is needed.~~


### Task 3 compute the distribution of the tiles in set
1. Don't want to check the distribution. 
2. It is better to do the statistics at each time steps.

#### Block 2
##### Goals
1. Finish the statistics of the distribution of tiles in Caches after the execution of each time steps.
output_pos, tile id, cur_ts, tile_0_rate, tile_1_rate, ..., tile_max_rate
2. Do the detailed distribution in sets.
