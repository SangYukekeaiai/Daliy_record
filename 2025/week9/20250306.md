# Tasks
1. Track and finish the visualization of the spike analyze

## Task 1
1. 10:00-10:30 Understand what is the function they provide
1. Understand what is the function of 
   ```python
   def hook_layers(model: nn.Module):

    avgmeter = AvgMeter()

    def save(layer, inputs, outputs):
        avgmeter.add(outputs.count_nonzero(), outputs.numel())

    for m in model.modules():
        if isinstance(m, (nn.ReLU, LIFSpike)):
            m.register_forward_hook(save)

    return avgmeter
   ```
2. Understand how `register_forward_hook()` works, and how to save each spike throughout time
3. Think about the logic of Spike and how this should be implemented, and ask chatGPT
   * Checkout the spike's structure
   * Check what is inside SFCN (20 min)
   * Implement the output data from LIF
4. Draw the output graph
   * Change the data to be the format I want
     * Design the format
     * Check the data format they have here
       * Check the size of the three demension
         * Not as what I thought(batch size is 64, neuron is 32, 64, 128, time steps is 129, 66, 35)
         * check the inference number
       * Check the batch size
     *
