## Tasks
1. Build up the flow

### Flow
1. Motivation Part:
   1. SNN is promising
   2. Current SNN's architecture and its feature
   3. Current SNN's architecture's on-chip memory loading from DRAM is inefficient
   4. Spiking behavior Exporation (Spiking behavior has temporal locality and fits in well with cache design)
2. Contribution:
   1. ~~Spiking behavior Exporation~~ 
   2. SNN Accelerator Implementation
   3. Neuromorphic Cache Design and Achievement
3. Background:
   1. Spinalflow Architecture Intro
   2. Layout of Input/output 
   3. Computation of Input/output
4. Methodology:
   1. Baseline Architecture Setup
   2. Benchmark Setup
   3. Data Reuse observation (Determine Replacement policy/ Cache Size)
      1. Data reuse in tiles 
      2. Weight Reuse Distance && Spike Event counts
   4. Data Access pattern observation (Determine Prefetcher policy)
   5. Overall Cache Setup
   6. Evaluation:
      1. Eviction Quality Measurement
      2. hit rate Measurement
      3. Latency ratio Measurement
      4. Energy Consumption Measurement
      5. Energy Consumption Measurement
