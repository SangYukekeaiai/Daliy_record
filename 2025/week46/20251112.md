## Questions
Also, I might need your guidance on a few points for the following parts:

1. I’m not sure which content should go under background and which should go under technical details. SpinalFlow seems to belong to both — it’s background, but also part of our simulator implementation.

2. When introducing SpinalFlow, I’m unsure about the most logical structure. Currently, I’m thinking of following the order in the SpinalFlow paper:

    * Start with the dataflow,

    * Then explain the stages/cycles required to generate one output spine,

    * Introduce the architectural components and their parameters in our simulator,

    * Show how input/output/weight are laid out and accessed in SRAM, and explain why we designed a cache specifically for weights.

3. For the cache part, I’m not sure whether it should go under technical details or experiment setup. Also, I’m not completely certain what’s the best way to present the cache results. My current idea is:

    * List the layer parameters of the benchmarks we used,

    * List our cache design parameters,

    * Explain in detail how our prefetcher works (since it differs from general cache designs).
    * (Question: since this prefetcher design came after several experiments, I’m not sure whether it should be included here.)

    * Start the analysis with metrics unrelated to cache configuration, like reuse distance and per-timestep input spiking events per tile. Then analyze cache-related metrics — e.g., wrong eviction counts, miss rate per timestep, and comparisons between Belady, cache with prefetcher, and without prefetcher.

    * Finally, compare area, energy, and latency.


## Comments
1. the flow looks ok to me, you might want to summarize one or twop keywords for each slide, so that people can instantly grab it
2. you can have spinalflow as bg
3. sounds good to me
4. cache can be setup, people should have know cache very well, just list whatever you have
its better to include what you have tried, this is part of your study
5. Currently, the design space is not thoroughly explored, so I dont think you can claim optimal. But in general optimal is a pareto front, not a single design point. pareto front is a line of optimal designs under certain constraints

### timeline-schedule
1. 11:00-12:30 think about how to show the dataflow
2. 13:30-15:00 For one output spine, how does this actually work
3. 15:30-17:00 Introduce the architectural components and their parameters in the simulator.
4. 17:00-19:00 Show the layout and access pattern
5. 22:30-0:00 List the Cache set up. (Do not do the reasoning here)
6. 0:00-2:00 List the prefether's mechanism.
7. 2:00-4:00 List the Layers' infomation
8. 4:00-8:00 List all the attempts I tried.
