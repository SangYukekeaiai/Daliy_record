# Tasks
1. The Motivation/Problem statement part of Slides/Report (Haven't estimated the time)
   1. SNN is promising (4 blocks of 30 mins)
   2. SNN accelerator----SpinalFlow (advantages) (4 blocks of 30 mins)
   3. SpinalFlow's disadvantage----Weight (4 blocks of 30 mins)
   4. Analysis of the weight usage (total loaded weight and actual used unique weight line) Show the non-deteriministic data pattern of weight usage, show the current storage solution is inefficient. (6 Blocks of 30 mins)
   5. Cache is good at the non-deteriministic data access, and the snn's feature will be nicely used by cache. (4 Blocks of 30 mins)

### Task 1.1
1. DNN --> MAC operation
2. SNN --> AC operation
3. We need to have the Formula to explain this part
4. It would be better to have the Architecture to show the difference
