## Questions
1. How to set the penalty of cache miss? Cache miss should be the latency to load data from dram? (128Btyes/BW of DRAM)
2. There will not be pre-load for weight cache during the run.
3. How to compute the increasement of efficiency? Throughput/area = (1/latency)/Size. Compare these two.



## Tasks
1. Change the configuration of cache. (penalty cycles, Cache ways. Remove the dram load part.) 2 Blocks.
2. Change the print part. 2 Blocks.
3. 1. Now for the csv file's generation(size_way_num_pre-fetch_num), It should have following record:
layer, demand_accesses, hits, misses, hit_cycles, miss_cycles, total_cycles, hit_rate, pre-fetch_requests
It should list rows from layer 0 to the end of layer. The last line should be the sum up of the above layers.
2. The pre-fetch number should be iterate through 0, 1, 2, 4, 8
3. the number of ways should be iterate through 4, 8, 16, 32
4. Ok, now iterate through 
pre-fetch depth(1, 2, 3, 4)
number of ways (4, 8, 16)
The previous cache_totals.csv should only compare between the cache with the same pre-fetch depth and number of ways.


## Questions
1. For pre-fetch part, is that ok to set the triggering condition as miss-triggered?
2. Do we need to clear the cache for the execution of each layer?
