Professor, here are the motivation questions about the details of designing a weight cache. I will also list the context here:
Context:
The Dataflow of the spinalflow is shown below:
For output spine i from [0, 0] to [H, W]: 
    Load Input spines of receptive field of out spine [i]: 
    For tile id from 0 to outC/128: Load Weight [tile_id][C_in][KW][KW][0-127]: 
       While input spines has entry: 
           Parallel For j from 0-127: 
               PE Computation 
           End Parallel For 
       End While 
    End For 
End For
