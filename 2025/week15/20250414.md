## Tasks
1. Repo 2 Part 1 Channel
   1. in one line
        * conv layer 1 and layer 2: each time step's spike changes smoothly, no shift
        * conv layer 3 and layer 4 has the same feature as before
        * conv layer 5, 6, 7 has the same feature 
   2. cross the line
       * No specific patterns  
       * conv layer 3 and conv layer 4 has a feature of wave. Like silent, stronger, full spiked, fade, silent
       * Kinda the same
   3. Compare with different layers
       * conv 1 and conv 2: No specific patterns (No consistancy)
       * conv3 and conv 4: The next layer's most active layer would be the ajacent channel of the previous channel
       *  The same. The spike behavior is concentrated to the middle
       *  The same for Layer 5, 6, 7
2. Repo 2 Part 1 Spine
   1. in one line:
       * conv 1 and 2, totally random, decline at about the half of time steps
       * conv 3 and 4, most of the spike behaviors count smoothly increase/decrease, but some of them will directly shift to slient
       * The same for conv 5, 6, 7
   2.  cross the line:
       * conv 1 and 2, no pattern
       * No strong patterns
       * The same for conv 5, 6, 7
   3. Compare with different layers
        * conv 1 and 2, no pattern
        * the most active spike behavior moves to the middle of the time steps
        * the same for conv 5, 6, 7
