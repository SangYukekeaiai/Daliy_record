   * store them
   * Draw the spike rate/CDN
   * Draw the heatmap
   * Draw the dot things
   * Apply to channels and draw spike rate/CDN
   * Draw heatmap

   * Apply to one spine
   * Draw heatmap
   * Draw dot things
3. Modify the first repo
4. Modify the second repo


### Task 1
#### Part 1
* Predict time: 20 min
* Real timeline: 
  1. Print each step, but the length of the steps are different, **Check the shape of the array**
  2. The shape of array is batch size, channel, height and width, however, time steps is missing. **Try to find out the time steps. Check how I implement this in first repo**
  3. Eat something. Continue at 9:00
  4. Things are different from what I thought. There must be a way to monitor how the timestep is being recorded. **Ask chatGPT about this question first, then try to figure out what is going on here**
  5. The Issue generated by the same name of the layer. **ChatGPT gives advice. Try to follow this and solve the problem**
  6. I am wondering why this happens. (The name inside the hook_fn is different from the parameter we gave)
  7. The output is like this: (time step, batch_size, channel, height, width). **Understand how the python framework works, why previous one not working**
  8. Get the sequence of the iteration. Next I need to check how the iteration goes
  9. Since the iteration shows, the output data is like [batch_index, layers, time steps, [batch size, channel size, height, width]] **Implement on our own version of the utils(stupid one)**
  10. concatenate the batch, and print the shape part.
  11. Finished:( Mother fucker!!!)
* Situations:
  * 1.1.6: Hungry, and feet got cold. Once the structure issue is solved, eat beef shank.
  * 1.1.8: Distracted. Once finished generating the standard data structure, rest 10 min.
