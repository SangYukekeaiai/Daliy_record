Replacement in practice: Many high-performance policies try to emulate MIN through various heuristics. DIP [30] avoids thrashing by inserting most lines at low priority, and detects when it is advantageous to do so. SDBP [21] and PRP [11] predict which lines are unlikely to be reused. RRIP [17, 39] and IbRDP [27] try to predict candidates’ times until reference. PDP [14] protects lines from eviction for a fixed number of accesses. IRGD [35] computes a statistical cost function from sampled reuse distance histograms. And Hawkeye [16] emulates MIN’s past decisions. Without a theoretical foundation, it is unclear if any of these policies takes the right approach. Indeed, no policy dominates across benchmarks (Sec. VII), suggesting that they are not making the best use of available information.
